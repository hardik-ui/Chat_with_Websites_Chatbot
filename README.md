# LangChain Chatbot with Streamlit GUI

This application is a chatbot capable of interacting with websites, extracting information, and communicating in a user-friendly manner. It leverages the power of LangChain 0.1.0 and integrates it with a Streamlit GUI for an enhanced user experience.

## Features
- **Website Interaction**: The chatbot uses the latest version of LangChain to interact with and extract information from various websites.
- **Large Language Model Integration**: Compatibility with models like GPT-4, Mistral, Llama2, and ollama. In this code I am using GPT-4, but we can change it to any other model.
- **Streamlit GUI**: A clean and intuitive user interface built with Streamlit, making it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
- **Python-based**: Entirely coded in Python.
